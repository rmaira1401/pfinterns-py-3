# Hotel Management System
Develop a hotel management system to manage reservations, guest information, and
billing. The system will include features for adding, updating, and canceling reservations,
as well as generating invoices. The completed project should consist of a database-driven
application with a graphical interface for managing hotel operations. It should allow staff to
view, add, update, and cancel reservations, as well as generate invoices for guest
transactions. Interns will gain experience in database management and CRUD (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) operations. They'll understand the requirements of managing hotel
reservations and billing in a real-world scenario. Basic Python programming,
understanding of database management concepts, knowledge of GUI development are
required.
